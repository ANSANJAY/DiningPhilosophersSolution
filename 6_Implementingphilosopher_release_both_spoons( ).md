# DiningPhilosophersSolution
An implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, focusing on concurrency control via mutexes and semaphores. This repo demonstrates how to manage multiple processes accessing shared resources, aiming to solve issues of deadlock and contention. Includes code examples and a guide.


## Philosopher's Second API Implementation üìù

### Introduction üìñ

- This section focuses on the **second API** implementation for the Dining Philosophers problem, specifically for releasing both spoons. The third API, for gaining access to both spoons, will follow.

### Releasing Both Spoons API ü•Ñü•Ñ

```C

/* 
 * Release the spoons once a philosopher has finished eating.
 */
void philosopher_release_both_spoons(phil_t *phil) {
	spoon_t *left_spoon  = phil_get_left_spoon(phil);
	spoon_t *right_spoon = phil_get_right_spoon(phil);

	pthread_mutex_lock(&left_spoon->mutex);
	pthread_mutex_lock(&right_spoon->mutex);

	// Validation to ensure correctness before releasing the spoons
	assert(left_spoon->phil == phil);
	assert(left_spoon->is_used == true);
	assert(right_spoon->phil == phil);
	assert(right_spoon->is_used == true);

	// Release left spoon
	printf("phil %d releasing the left spoon %d\n", phil->phil_id, left_spoon->spoon_id);
	left_spoon->phil = NULL;
	left_spoon->is_used = false;
	pthread_cond_signal(&left_spoon->cv);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&left_spoon->mutex);

	// Release right spoon
	printf("phil %d releasing the right spoon %d\n", phil->phil_id, right_spoon->spoon_id);
	right_spoon->phil = NULL;
	right_spoon->is_used = false;
	pthread_cond_signal(&right_spoon->cv);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&right_spoon->mutex);
}


```

1. **Purpose**:
   - A philosopher releases both spoons, marking them as available.
   - Assumes the philosopher already has access to both spoons.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Start by getting pointers to both the **left** and **right spoons** using helper APIs.
   - Lock resources (spoons) before changing their state, to prevent concurrency issues.
   - **Sanity checks**: Ensure the spoons are indeed occupied by the philosopher using assert statements.
     - If any assert fails, there's an inconsistency in the state of data structures.
   - Mark spoons as available, using `printf` for clear output.
   - Send a **signal** to the condition variable of the released spoon, signaling waiting for philosophers.
   - Unlock the mutex of the left spoon.

3. **Key Concept**:
   - The philosopher acts as a **producer**, making resources (spoons) available.
   - Aligns with the typical producer-consumer problem, which is foundational in thread synchronization.
   - Steps:
     - **S6**: Lock the resource's mutex.
     - **S7**: Check resource state.
     - **S8**: Produce or make the resource available.
     - **S9**: Send a signal and unlock the mutex.
   - Repeat steps for both left and right spoons.

4. **Philosopher's Role**:
   - Acts as both producer (releasing spoons) and, in other parts, consumer (acquiring spoons).



### Assert üìö

In the provided code, the `assert` function is used as a diagnostic tool to enforce certain invariants or conditions in the program. If any of these conditions evaluates as `false`, the program will terminate with an error message, allowing the developer to catch and investigate potential logic flaws.

Here's a breakdown of each `assert` and its purpose:

1. `assert(left_spoon->phil == phil);` 
    - This checks that the philosopher (`phil`) associated with the left spoon is indeed the current philosopher. It ensures that the philosopher who is trying to release the spoon is the one who currently holds it.

2. `assert(left_spoon->is_used == true);`
    - This ensures that the left spoon is currently in use. If it's not, then there's a logic flaw since a philosopher shouldn't be releasing a spoon they haven't acquired.

3. `assert(right_spoon->phil == phil);`
    - Similar to the first assertion, this checks that the philosopher associated with the right spoon is indeed the current philosopher.

4. `assert(right_spoon->is_used == true);`
    - This checks that the right spoon is currently in use. It's a safety check, similar to the second assertion, but for the right spoon.

If any of these conditions is not met, there is likely a flaw or bug in the logic leading up to this function call, or in the state management of the philosophers and spoons.

## Interview Questions & Answers ü§îüí¨

1. **Q**: What is the main purpose of the "releasing both spoons" API?
   - **A**: The API is designed to allow a philosopher to release (or mark as available) both the spoons he possesses, assuming he already has access to them.

2. **Q**: Why is locking necessary before changing the state of the spoons?
   - **A**: Locking is essential to prevent multiple threads (philosophers) from concurrently accessing and modifying the spoon state, which could lead to data inconsistencies or race conditions.

3. **Q**: What role does the philosopher play in the context of the producer-consumer problem?
   - **A**: In the "releasing both spoons" scenario, the philosopher acts as a producer, making resources (spoons) available for other philosophers to consume or use.

4. **Q**: What happens after a philosopher releases a spoon?
   - **A**: After releasing a spoon, the philosopher sends a signal on the spoon's condition variable. This signal can be picked up by a waiting philosopher, allowing them to attempt to acquire the spoon.

5. **Q**: Why are sanity checks, like assert statements, used in the implementation?
   - **A**: Sanity checks ensure the spoons are indeed occupied by the philosopher releasing them. If any assert fails, it indicates an inconsistency or error in the state of the program's data structures.
