# DiningPhilosophersSolution
An implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem, focusing on concurrency control via mutexes and semaphores. This repo demonstrates how to manage multiple processes accessing shared resources, aiming to solve issues of deadlock and contention. Includes code examples and a guide.


#  Executing the Dining Philosophers Solution üçΩÔ∏è

## Running the Solution üèÉ

1. An executable `Dining_exe` has been created to execute the solution.
2. When this executable is run, numerous logs (or printf statements) appear on the screen. 
3. It's challenging to make sense of these logs just by glancing at them on the console. ü§î

## Managing Logs üìú

1. A strategy is proposed: **redirect these logs to a file**, say `temp`.
2. Let the solution run for a brief time, like 20 to 30 seconds, then stop it.
3. Open the `temp` file. This file will contain all the print statements the solution has generated during its run. 
4. You don't need to inspect the entire file. Just start by reading the initial 50 to 100 lines. This should help confirm that the logs align with the logic of the program. 

## Verifying Solution Output ‚úÖ

1. To verify the solution, look at the function `philosopher_eat` where there's a printf statement displaying:
   - Philosopher ID 
   - Left and right spoon IDs
   - How many times the philosopher has eaten 
2. This printf statement is crucial. To extract this info from the `temp` file, use the **`grep` command** with the keyword `times` and save the output to a file named `result`.
3. Upon inspecting the `result` file, the last few lines should show how many times each philosopher has eaten. 

   * For instance, seeing that philosophers have eaten approximately 11, 12, or 13 times indicates a well-balanced access.
   * However, if one philosopher has only eaten 3 or 4 times, this could hint at a deadlock in the program. üòü

4. The program should consistently show that each philosopher eats with the **same set of spoons**. For example, if philosopher three eats with spoons three and two, this pair should remain constant. There shouldn't be any inconsistency like philosopher number four eating with different sets of spoons at different times.

## Conclusion üéâ

- This wraps up the dining philosopher problem. Careful analysis of the output ensures the correctness of the solution and whether all philosopher threads are getting their fair share.

# Interview Questions üìù


2. **Question**: How do you verify the correctness of the Dining Philosophers' solution from the generated output?

   **Answer**: The key was to inspect the function `philosopher_eat`, which had a printf statement displaying the Philosopher ID, their spoons, and their eating count. By grepping this data and analyzing the result, we could verify if each philosopher ate approximately the same number of times and with a consistent pair of spoons.

3. **Question**: What could it indicate if one philosopher has eaten significantly fewer times than the others?

   **Answer**: If one philosopher has eaten considerably fewer times, it might hint at a potential deadlock in the program where that philosopher thread is being blocked or starved.

4. **Question**: Why is it essential that each philosopher always eats with the same set of spoons?

   **Answer**: For a given philosopher, the pair of spoons is fixed and constant. If the program shows a philosopher eating with different spoons at different times, it indicates a logic error in the solution.
